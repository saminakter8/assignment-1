                    Natural disasters destroy almost 98% of wealth including food. For the lack of healthy food people
                    infected many kinds of diseases. So, We are trying to manage foods which is helpful for their
                    health.

                <p>
                    When any disaster will come, People of disaster area consider about their shelter. Because they know
                    it clearly that if the velocity of air and shelters of the area are not paved house than their house
                    will be vanished.
